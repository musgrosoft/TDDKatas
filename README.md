# TDDKatas

## Beginner .NET TDD Katas

These Katas will introduce the topic of Test-Driven-Development (TDD). 

This is the process of writing your tests first, before writing your code.

- Write a test
- Make it Pass
- Refactor your code

We will tackle some simple problems (FizzBuzz, StringCalculator, Roman Numerals), so that we can focus on the process of TDD, rather than the complexity of the problem.

We'll be using C#, .NET 6, xUnit, FluentAssertions.

If we have time well look at using Moq to mock dependencies.
